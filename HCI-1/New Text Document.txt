6. **Long-lasting**: It is timeless and durable.
7. **Environmental**: It conserves resources and is sustainable.
8. **Thorough**: It pays attention to detail and leaves no part overlooked.

### What Is Bad Design?

Bad design creates unnecessary complications, confusion, or frustration for the user. It often prioritizes aesthetics or novelty over functionality, leading to inefficiency or even harm. Common signs of bad design include:
1. **Unintuitive**: The user struggles to understand how it works.
2. **Overcomplicated**: Too many steps or features make it difficult to use.
3. **Unreliable**: The product may break easily or not work as expected.
4. **Inconvenient**: It may not fit well into the user’s life or workflow.
5. **Misleading**: Information is presented in a way that confuses or deceives the user.

### Two Examples of Good Design:

1. **Apple iPhone**: 
   - **Why it’s good**: The iPhone is known for its sleek design, intuitive user interface, and reliability. It follows a minimalist approach that hides complexity behind simple gestures and features, like touch-to-unlock, making the phone user-friendly for almost any demographic. It combines form and function perfectly.
   - **Dieter Rams’ principles**: The iPhone is innovative, aesthetic, functional, and user-friendly.

2. **Google Search Engine**:
   - **Why it’s good**: Google’s search engine is incredibly efficient and easy to use. The interface is clean and simple, focusing solely on functionality. The search algorithm delivers highly relevant results quickly and efficiently, enhancing the overall user experience.
   - **Dieter Rams’ principles**: Google Search is functional, thorough, and focuses on making technology accessible to all.

### Two Examples of Bad Design:

1. **Windows Vista (Operating System)**:
   - **Why it’s bad**: Windows Vista was criticized for being slow, difficult to use, and riddled with security issues. It required significant hardware resources and had a confusing User Account Control (UAC) feature that annoyed users with frequent pop-up windows asking for permissions.
   - **Design flaws**: It was overcomplicated and intrusive, compromising user satisfaction and productivity.

2. **Pepsi’s 2009 Logo Redesign**:
   - **Why it’s bad**: Pepsi spent millions on a redesign that looked almost identical to the old logo but was widely criticized for being less recognizable and lacking the brand’s former identity. The new design felt uninspired and unnecessary.
   - **Design flaws**: The logo lacked innovation, and the changes alienated users without solving any problem. It confused brand recognition.
