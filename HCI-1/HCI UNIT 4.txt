MVC :- DO IT FROM THE DECODE

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework divides an application into three interconnected components, promoting organized and scalable development. Here's an explanation of each component in the context of a task management app:

Model:

Represents the data and business logic of the application.
In the task management app, this would include the structure for tasks (e.g., task name, due date, status) and operations like adding, updating, or deleting tasks.
View:

Represents the user interface and the presentation of data.
For the task management app, this would be the task list display, input forms, and any visual feedback provided to the user.
Controller:

Acts as the intermediary between the Model and the View.
Handles user input from the View, updates the Model accordingly, and retrieves updated data to refresh the View.
Interaction Flow:

The View captures user input (e.g., adding a new task).
The Controller processes this input, updating the Model.
The Model notifies the View of any changes, ensuring that the displayed data is up-to-date.
