The Chomsky Hierarchy is a classification of formal languages based on their generative power, introduced by the linguist and cognitive scientist Noam Chomsky in 1956. This hierarchy provides a way of understanding the complexity of different types of formal languages and the types of grammars that generate them. It divides languages into four types, each associated with a different level of generative grammar. These are:

1. Type 0 - Recursively Enumerable Languages (RE):
Grammar: Unrestricted grammars (also called Type 0 grammars).
Machine: Turing machines.
Description: These languages can be generated by an unrestricted grammar, which has no constraints on the production rules. In other words, the rules can be as general as needed. A Turing machine can decide whether a string belongs to a recursively enumerable language, but it may not always halt for strings not in the language.
Example: Some problems in computation theory, like the Halting Problem, deal with recursively enumerable languages.

2. Type 1 - Context-Sensitive Languages (CSL):
Grammar: Context-sensitive grammars.
Machine: Linear-bounded automata (LBA).
Description: Context-sensitive languages are more restrictive than recursively enumerable languages. The production rules of a context-sensitive grammar must ensure that the length of the string on the left-hand side of the rule is less than or equal to the length of the string on the right-hand side (i.e., no rule shortens the string). A linear-bounded automaton can recognize context-sensitive languages, but it uses limited space.
Example: An example of a context-sensitive language is the language consisting of strings of the form {a^n b^n c^n | n ≥ 1}, which can only be generated by a context-sensitive grammar.

3. Type 2 - Context-Free Languages (CFL):
Grammar: Context-free grammars (CFG).
Machine: Pushdown automata (PDA).
Description: Context-free languages are generated by context-free grammars, where each production rule has a single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side. These languages are widely used in programming language syntax and can be recognized by a pushdown automaton, which is a finite automaton equipped with a stack to handle nested structures.
Example: A classic example of a context-free language is the set of balanced parentheses {(,)}*. The syntax of many programming languages (like arithmetic expressions or function calls) is context-free.

4. Type 3 - Regular Languages:
Grammar: Regular grammars.
Machine: Finite automata (DFA/NFA).
Description: Regular languages are the simplest and least expressive in the Chomsky hierarchy. These languages can be generated by regular grammars, which are restricted to rules that allow only one non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side. Regular languages can be recognized by finite automata (deterministic or nondeterministic) and are the languages accepted by regular expressions.

Example: Regular expressions for matching simple patterns like email addresses, phone numbers, or strings that consist only of certain characters are regular languages.

CONVERTING INTO CHOMSKY NORMAL FORM 

WRITE THE STEP-WISE SOLUTON OF THE CODE

1. Remove the null productions (if any):
The given grammar does not have any null productions, so we can skip this step.

2. Remove the unit productions (if any):
The grammar does not have any unit productions (rules where a non-terminal directly derives another non-terminal), so we can skip this step as well.

3. Remove the terminal symbols from the right-hand side of rules with more than one symbol:
In the production 

4. 4. Break down the production rules that have more than two symbols on the right-hand side:

// AMBIGIOUS GRAMMER & UNAMBIGIOUS GRAMMER :-  (SHOW THE AMBIGIOUS USING THE BOTH DERIVATION AS WELL AS PARSE TREE)


Ambiguous Grammar:
A grammar is said to be ambiguous if there exists at least one string in the language generated by the grammar that can be derived in more than one way (i.e., it has multiple leftmost derivations or multiple parse trees).

In other words, an ambiguous grammar can generate the same string using different sequences of production rules, leading to different interpretations or structures of the same string.

Example of an Ambiguous Grammar:
Consider the following context-free grammar 
𝐺
G:
S→S+S
S→S×S
S→a
This grammar generates expressions with the terminal symbol a and the operators + and *.

String: a + a + a
Let’s see if the grammar is ambiguous by considering the string a + a + a and deriving it in different ways:

First Derivation (using + first):

𝑆
→
𝑆
+
𝑆
S→S+S (Using production 1)
𝑆
→
𝑎
S→a (Using production 3) for the first S
𝑆
→
𝑎
+
𝑎
S→a+a (Again using production 1 for the second S)
𝑆
→
𝑎
S→a (Using production 3) for the third S
So, the string a + a + a is derived as:

𝑆
→
𝑎
+
(
𝑎
+
𝑎
)
S→a+(a+a)
Second Derivation (using + second):

𝑆
→
𝑆
+
𝑆
S→S+S (Using production 1)
𝑆
→
𝑎
+
𝑎
S→a+a (Using production 1 for the first S)
𝑆
→
𝑎
S→a (Using production 3) for the second S
So, the string a + a + a is derived as:

𝑆
→
(
𝑎
+
𝑎
)
+
𝑎
S→(a+a)+a
Both derivations produce the string a + a + a, but the structure (i.e., the way the operations are grouped) is different. This means that the grammar is ambiguous because the same string can have different parse trees, which lead to different interpretations (e.g., different order of operations in arithmetic).

Parse Trees:
Here’s how the two derivations look as parse trees:

Parse Tree for a + (a + a):

css
Copy code
      S
     /|\
    S + S
   / \   / \
  a   +  a  a
      / \
     a   a
Parse Tree for (a + a) + a:

css
Copy code
      S
     /|\
    S + S
   / \   / \
  +   a  a   a
 / \
a   a
In these two trees, we can see that the grouping of as and + is different, confirming the ambiguity.

Consequences of Ambiguity:
Multiple Interpretations: In programming languages, ambiguity in grammar can lead to multiple interpretations of a program, which can cause inconsistencies or errors in execution. For example, arithmetic expressions could yield different results depending on how the operations are grouped.

Parsing Difficulty: Ambiguous grammars are harder to parse because a parser might not be able to determine the correct structure of a string without additional context.

Unambiguous Grammar:
An unambiguous grammar is one in which each string generated by the grammar has exactly one leftmost derivation or parse tree. Unambiguous grammars are preferred for programming languages because they provide a clear and consistent interpretation of expressions.

In the case of the example above, a common way to resolve the ambiguity is to enforce operator precedence, such as giving multiplication higher precedence than addition. An unambiguous grammar could be constructed as:

𝑆
→
𝑆
+
𝑇
S→S+T
𝑇
→
𝑇
×
𝑎
 
∣
 
𝑎
T→T×a ∣ a
This grammar ensures that multiplication binds more tightly than addition.


// REGULAR AND NON REGULAR GRAMMER

### **Regular Grammar:**

A **regular grammar** is a type of formal grammar that generates **regular languages**, which are the simplest class of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy. Regular grammars are used to describe languages that can be recognized by **finite automata** and can be expressed using **regular expressions**.

A **regular grammar** consists of production rules where the left-hand side is always a non-terminal symbol, and the right-hand side consists of either:
- A single terminal symbol, or
- A terminal symbol followed by a non-terminal symbol, or
- An empty string (denoted by \( \epsilon \)).

### **Formal Definition of Regular Grammar:**
A **regular grammar** is a context-free grammar (CFG) that satisfies one of the following two forms for each production rule:
1. **Right-linear grammar**: The production rules are of the form \( A \to xB \) or \( A \to x \), where:
   - \( A, B \) are non-terminal symbols,
   - \( x \) is a terminal symbol, and
   - \( A \to xB \) means that the non-terminal \( A \) can be replaced by a terminal \( x \) followed by another non-terminal \( B \), and \( A \to x \) means \( A \) can be replaced by just a terminal symbol \( x \).
   
2. **Left-linear grammar**: The production rules are of the form \( A \to Bx \) or \( A \to x \), where:
   - \( A, B \) are non-terminal symbols,
   - \( x \) is a terminal symbol, and
   - \( A \to Bx \) means that the non-terminal \( A \) can be replaced by another non-terminal \( B \) followed by a terminal \( x \), and \( A \to x \) means \( A \) can be replaced by just a terminal symbol \( x \).

### **Types of Regular Grammar:**
Regular grammars can be classified into two main types based on the form of their production rules:

#### 1. **Right-Linear Grammar**:
In a right-linear grammar, all the production rules have the following structure:
- \( A \to xB \) (where \( A \) is a non-terminal, \( x \) is a terminal, and \( B \) is a non-terminal), or
- \( A \to x \) (where \( A \) is a non-terminal, and \( x \) is a terminal).

**Example of a Right-Linear Grammar**:
Consider the language of strings over the alphabet \( \{a, b\} \) consisting of one or more \( a \)'s followed by one or more \( b \)'s (e.g., \( a^n b^n \) for \( n \geq 1 \)).

A regular grammar for this language could be:

1. \( S \to aS \)  
2. \( S \to b \)

Here, the rule \( S \to aS \) means that \( S \) can be replaced by \( aS \), and the rule \( S \to b \) means that \( S \) can be replaced by \( b \). This is a right-linear grammar because the non-terminal \( S \) appears at the end of the production.

#### 2. **Left-Linear Grammar**:
In a left-linear grammar, all the production rules have the following structure:
- \( A \to Bx \) (where \( A \) is a non-terminal, \( B \) is a non-terminal, and \( x \) is a terminal), or
- \( A \to x \) (where \( A \) is a non-terminal, and \( x \) is a terminal).

**Example of a Left-Linear Grammar**:
Consider the language of strings over the alphabet \( \{a, b\} \) consisting of one or more \( b \)'s followed by one or more \( a \)'s (e.g., \( b^n a^n \) for \( n \geq 1 \)).

A left-linear grammar for this language could be:

1. \( S \to Sb \)
2. \( S \to a \)

Here, the rule \( S \to Sb \) means that \( S \) can be replaced by \( Sb \), and the rule \( S \to a \) means that \( S \) can be replaced by \( a \). This is a left-linear grammar because the non-terminal \( S \) appears at the beginning of the production.


### **Example:**

Let's create a regular grammar for the language \( L = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \). 

This language consists of strings of \( a \)'s followed by \( b \)'s. The regular grammar can be written as:

1. \( S \to aS \)  
2. \( S \to bS \)  
3. \( S \to \epsilon \)

The grammar allows for an arbitrary number of \( a \)'s followed by an arbitrary number of \( b \)'s.

 Explain any three closure properties of Context Free language.

-->

### **Closure Properties of Context-Free Languages (CFLs)**

Context-Free Languages (CFLs) are a class of languages that can be generated by **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)**. One of the important features of CFLs is that they are **closed under certain operations**, meaning that performing specific operations on CFLs results in a language that is still a CFL.

Here, we will explain **three closure properties of Context-Free Languages**:

---

### 1. **Closure under Union**:

**Union** refers to combining two languages to form a new language that contains all the strings from both languages.

- **Property**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are context-free languages, then their **union** \( L_1 \cup L_2 \) is also a context-free language.

- **Explanation**: The union of two context-free languages can be generated by constructing a new context-free grammar that generates either the strings from \( L_1 \) or the strings from \( L_2 \).

  If we have:
  - A CFG \( G_1 \) for \( L_1 \), and
  - A CFG \( G_2 \) for \( L_2 \),
  
  Then, we can construct a new CFG \( G \) for \( L_1 \cup L_2 \) by introducing a new start symbol \( S \) and defining new production rules:
  
  - \( S \to S_1 \ | \ S_2 \)
  
  where \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are the start symbols of \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \), respectively.

- **Example**:
  
  Let \( L_1 = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \) and \( L_2 = \{ b^n a^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \). The union \( L_1 \cup L_2 \) would be the language of strings that are either of the form \( a^n b^n \) or \( b^n a^n \), both of which are context-free.

---

### 2. **Closure under Concatenation**:

**Concatenation** refers to joining two languages together by appending all strings of one language to the strings of another.

- **Property**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are context-free languages, then their **concatenation** \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \) is also a context-free language.

- **Explanation**: The concatenation of two CFLs can be generated by a CFG that generates the strings from \( L_1 \), followed by the strings from \( L_2 \). If we have:
  - A CFG \( G_1 \) for \( L_1 \),
  - A CFG \( G_2 \) for \( L_2 \),
  
  Then, we can construct a new CFG \( G \) for \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \) by modifying the grammar rules to concatenate the derivations from \( G_1 \) and \( G_2 \).

  - The start symbol \( S \) of the new grammar can produce a string by first deriving from \( G_1 \), then from \( G_2 \).

- **Example**:
  
  If \( L_1 = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \) and \( L_2 = \{ b^n a^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \), their concatenation \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \) would be the set of strings of the form \( a^n b^n b^m a^m \), which is still a context-free language.

---

### 3. **Closure under Kleene Star**:

The **Kleene Star** operation on a language refers to the set of all possible concatenations of zero or more strings from that language.

- **Property**: If \( L \) is a context-free language, then \( L^* \) (the Kleene star of \( L \)) is also a context-free language.

- **Explanation**: The Kleene star operation can be performed on a context-free language by constructing a new CFG that can generate:
  - The empty string \( \epsilon \), and
  - Any number of concatenations of strings from \( L \).

  If we have:
  - A CFG \( G \) for \( L \),
  
  Then, we can construct a new CFG \( G' \) for \( L^* \) by adding rules to generate the empty string and allow the concatenation of any number of strings from \( L \).

- **Example**:
  
  If \( L = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \), then \( L^* \) would be the set of strings consisting of zero or more concatenated strings of the form \( a^n b^n \), such as \( \epsilon \), \( a^1 b^1 \), \( a^2 b^2 a^3 b^3 \), etc. This is still a context-free language.

---

### **Summary of the Three Closure Properties**:

1. **Closure under Union**: The union of two CFLs is a CFL.
2. **Closure under Concatenation**: The concatenation of two CFLs is a CFL.
3. **Closure under Kleene Star**: The Kleene star of a CFL is a CFL.

These closure properties make CFLs a useful class of languages for many practical applications, such as programming languages, where operations like concatenation, alternation, and repetition are common in language definitions and regular expressions.



//
RLG TO FINITE AUTOMETA 

To convert a right-linear grammar (RLG) into a finite automaton (FA), follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Grammar
The given RLG is:

1. \( S \rightarrow 0A \ | \ 1B \ | \ 0 \ | \ 1 \)
2. \( A \rightarrow 0S \ | \ 1B \ | \ 1 \)
3. \( B \rightarrow 0A \ | \ 1S \)

### Step 2: Define the Components of the FA
An FA consists of:
- **States:** Represent the non-terminals \( S, A, \) and \( B \), along with a final state \( q_f \).
- **Transitions:** Derived from the grammar rules.
- **Start State:** The start symbol \( S \).
- **Final State(s):** States corresponding to terminals with no further derivation (here, transitions that directly output \( 0 \) or \( 1 \)).

### Step 3: Construct the FA
#### States:
- \( S, A, B, q_f \)

#### Transitions:
Each rule in the grammar contributes to transitions:
1. From \( S \):
   - \( S \xrightarrow{0} A \)
   - \( S \xrightarrow{1} B \)
   - \( S \xrightarrow{0} q_f \)
   - \( S \xrightarrow{1} q_f \)

2. From \( A \):
   - \( A \xrightarrow{0} S \)
   - \( A \xrightarrow{1} B \)
   - \( A \xrightarrow{1} q_f \)

3. From \( B \):
   - \( B \xrightarrow{0} A \)
   - \( B \xrightarrow{1} S \)

### Step 4: Draw the FA
The resulting FA has the following transitions:

| State | Input 0   | Input 1   |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| \( S \)   | \( A, q_f \) | \( B, q_f \) |
| \( A \)   | \( S \)       | \( B, q_f \) |
| \( B \)   | \( A \)       | \( S \)     |

#### Final State:
- \( q_f \) (accepts strings ending in \( 0 \) or \( 1 \)).

This is the finite automaton equivalent of the given RLG.
